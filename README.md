This is a place to showcase some of my work.

# Ashley
Project Ashley is for someone specific but the technologies will be showcase-worthy.

## TO-DO for Ashley
Secrets: two different kinds. Some that need to be reassembled into plaintext without being easily extracted from the source code, and some that don't need to be known (can just be hashes or something).

So ultimately I'll need some kind of scramble/descramble routine for things that need to be reassembled and a hashing tool to create/maintain the answers to questions.
